            <h3>Welcome.
                My name is Elvis, I'm 28 years old and I study programming by myself. I got a computer for my birthday and that's when I created the desire to program, to give myself an opportunity to change my life.
                </h3>
                <p>
                I'm Brazilian, I'm 28 years old and I'm learning to program by myself. I had never taken a programming course like this, I understand that through studying they will open doors for my life, and also later on being able to help my family. I believe in God, I'm a Christian, I have a spiritual basis in my life, I also study a little astrology.</p>
                <p>I'm from the interior of São Paulo and I'm looking for a volunteer position in the United States, I don't speak fluent English, I study alone, I want to be able to gain experience and live from it. I wake up every day at 7 am to study, and I want to be able to be a remote front-end developer, gain experience and improve my English. I really want to live off this and help my family. They depend on me, thanks for the opportunity, nice to see you here, nice to meet you.
               </p>
               <p>My instrumental music recordings, below, I play the guitar and I'm a drummer, I love art.<p>
